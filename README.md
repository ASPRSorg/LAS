# ASPRS LAS Specification

This repository is the official collaborative editing environment for the ASPRS
LAS Working Group (LWG). We are responsible for maintaining the ASPRS LAS
Specification, the remote sensing industry's most widely used file format for
point cloud data. 

The current published version of the ASPRS LAS Specification can be found at
https://www.asprs.org/committee-general/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities.html

## Repo Contents

* The [source code](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/tree/master/source) folder
contains the content of the specification itself. Everything else is the support
codebase for generating the PDFs. You probably aren't interested in that.
* The [Wiki pages](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/wiki) supplement the formal
specification to assist with its interpretation and implementation.
* The [Issues page](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues) is your tool to
request changes to the wiki pages or specification.

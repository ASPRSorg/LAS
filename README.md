# ASPRS LAS Specification

This repository is the official collaborative editing environment for the ASPRS
LAS Working Group (LWG). We are responsible for maintaining the ASPRS LAS
Specification, the remote sensing industry's most widely used file format for
point cloud data. 

The current published version of the ASPRS LAS Specification can be found at
https://www.asprs.org/committee-general/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities.html

## Contents

* The [source code](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/tree/master/source) folder
contains the content of the specification itself. Everything else is the support
codebase for generating the PDFs. You probably aren't interested in that.
* The [Wiki pages](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/wiki) supplement the formal
specification to assist with its interpretation and implementation.
* The [Issues page](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues) is your tool to
request changes to the wiki pages or specification.

Once you have an account, you can [Watch](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/subscription)
this repository to subscribe to email updates whenever the specification
changes. That way you can anticipate changes that might break your favorite
point cloud software, or find out about new features that could enrich your LAS
product line.

### Level 2 Involvement - Contribute
Get on the [Issues](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues) page and participate
in the conversation while letting the LWG do the hard work of making the actual
edits to the source code. Browse through and comment on existing topics, click
[Milestones](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/milestones) to see what changes are
coming in the next revisions, or create new issues.

Any contributions are more than welcome! Please check the
[closed issues](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

What merits a new issue? Here are a few examples:
* Fix a typo in the specification
* Request a new wiki page
* Clarify an ambiguity
* Clarify how something applies to your application
* Request new fields
* Submit a VLR or ExtraByte definition

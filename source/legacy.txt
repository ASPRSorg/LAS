Legacy Compatibility (LAS 1.1 – LAS 1.3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAS 1.4 moves the file specification from a 32 bit file structure (maximum
value of :math:`2^{32}-1 \equiv 4,294,967,295 \equiv \mbox{UINT32\_MAX}`) to a
64 bit file structure (:math:`2^{64} - 1`).

To maintain the ability to place a LAS 1.1 through LAS 1.3 payload (point
record types 0-5, GeoTIFF coordinate reference system, referred to as “Legacy”
payloads) in a LAS 1.4 file structure, it was necessary to duplicate some of
the fields within the LAS 1.4 file structure. These duplicate fields are named
“Legacy xxx” where “xxx” denotes the meaning of the field.

A LAS 1.4 file writer who wishes to maintain backward compatibility must
maintain both the legacy fields and the equivalent non-legacy fields in
synchronization. Of course, this is not possible if the number of points
exceeds UINT32_MAX, in which case the legacy fields must be set to zero. If a
file writer is not maintaining backward compatibility, the legacy fields must
always be set to zero.

If there is a discrepancy between a non-zero legacy field and the equivalent
LAS 1.4 field, the LAS 1.4 reader should use the legacy value to maintain the
same behavior as a LAS 1.1 through LAS 1.3 reader. Best practice is to also
throw an informative error so that the file can be repaired.

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose, Scope, and Applicability
................................................................................

The LASer (LAS) file is intended to contain point cloud data records,
including those derived from lidar or other sources.
The data will commonly be put into this format from software (e.g., provided by
hardware vendors), which combines GPS, IMU, and laser pulse range data to
produce points with X, Y, and Z coordinates. The purpose of LAS is to provide
an open format that allows different hardware and software tools to
exchange point cloud data in a common format.

This document reflects the fourth revision of the LAS format specification
since its initial version 1.0 release.

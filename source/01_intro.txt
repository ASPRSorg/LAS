Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose, Scope, and Applicability
................................................................................

The LAS file is intended to contain LIDAR (or other) point cloud data records.
The data will generally be put into this format from software (e.g. provided by
LIDAR hardware vendors) which combines GPS, IMU, and laser pulse range data to
produce X, Y, and Z point data. The intention of the data format is to provide
an open format that allows different LIDAR hardware and software tools to
output data in a common format.

This document reflects the fourth revision of the LAS format specification
since its initial version 1.0 release.


LAS 1.4 Revision History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary of LAS 1.4 revisions:

* R11 - Approved Version (Nov 2011)
* R12 - Errata (June 2012) - Typographical corrections:

  * Corrected Public Header size in descriptive paragraph to 375 bytes
  * Corrected two instances of Scan Angle Rank from "Unsigned Char" to "Char"

* R13 - Added Domain Profile Section (July 2013)
* R14 - Multiple updates (GitHub Issue numbers):

  * Aesthetic changes from migration to GitHub
  * Updated ASPRS contact info.
    (`I-30 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/30>`_)
  * Additional standard classifications 19-22 for PDRFs 6-10:

    * Class 19 -- Overhead Structure in PDRFs 6-10.
      (`I-26 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/26>`_)
    * Class 20 -- Ignored Ground.
      (`I-11 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/11>`_)
    * Class 21 -- Snow. (I-11)
    * Class 22 -- Temporal Exclusion (I-11)

  * Added minimum PDRF sizes to attribute tables.
    (`I-47 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/47>`_)
  * Section reorganization:
    (`I-57 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/57>`_)

    * Addition of Table of Contents with section numbers. (c.f. 
      `I-27 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/27>`_,
      `I-49 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/49>`_)
    * Divided "Defined Variable Length Records" section into Coordinate
      Reference System VLRs section (s3) and Other Specification Defined
      VLRs (s4).
    * Expanded EVLR discussion in Legacy Compatibility section (s2.1) and moved
      Legacy Compatibility section to EVLR definition (now s2.7.1).
    * Swapped order of LAS 1.4 Revision History (now s1.1.1) and
      LAS 1.4 Additions (now s1.1.2).

  * Changed type of ExtraByte min/max from ``anytype`` to ``double`` and
    clarified that min/max should be a transformed value.
    (`I-4 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/4>`_)
  * Clarified that Legacy Point Counts should be set to zero if using non-legacy
    PDRFs. (`I-12 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/12>`_)
  * PDRF9 now correctly requires Scanner Channel like other PDRFs.
    (`I-29 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/29>`_)
  * Clarified origin date/time for Adjusted Standard GPS Time.
    (`I-40 <https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS/issues/40>`_)

Comparison of LAS 1.4 to Previous Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The additions of LAS 1.4 include:

* Backward compatibility with LAS 1.1 â€“ LAS 1.3 when payloads consist of only
  legacy content
* LAS 1.4 mode which supports

  * Extension of offsets and field sizes to support full 64 bit
  * Support for up to 15 returns per outgoing pulse
  * Extension of the Point Class field to support 256 classes
  * Definition of several new ASPRS standard classes
  * Extension of the Scan Angle field to 2 bytes to support finer angle resolution
  * Addition of a Sensor Channel bit field to support mobile mapping systems
  * Addition of Well Known Text (WKT) definitions for Coordinate Reference
    Systems
  * Addition of an Overlap bit to allow indicating pulses in the overlap
    region while maintaining the class definition
  * Addition of an (optional) Extra Byte Variable Length Record to describe
    "extra bytes" stored with each point

* Other minor changes

  * Added definitions for "LAS Domain Profile" and "LAS Domain Profile
    Description"

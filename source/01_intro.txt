Purpose, Scope, and Applicability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LAS file is intended to contain LIDAR (or other) point cloud data records.
The data will generally be put into this format from software (e.g. provided by
LIDAR hardware vendors) which combines GPS, IMU, and laser pulse range data to
produce X, Y, and Z point data. The intention of the data format is to provide
an open format that allows different LIDAR hardware and software tools to
output data in a common format.

This document reflects the fourth revision of the LAS format specification
since its initial version 1.0 release.

The additions of LAS 1.4 include:

* Backward compatibility with LAS 1.1 â€“ LAS 1.3 when payloads consist of only
  legacy content
* LAS 1.4 Mode which supports

  * Extension of offsets and field sizes to support full 64 bit
  * Support for up to 15 returns per outgoing pulse
  * Extension of the Point Class field to support 256 classes
  * Definition of several new ASPRS standard classes
  * Extension of the Scan Angle field to 2 bytes to support finer angle resolution
  * Addition of a Sensor Channel bit field to support mobile mapping systems
  * Addition of Well Known Text (WKT) definitions for Coordinate Reference
    Systems
  * Addition of an Overlap bit to allow indicating pulses in the overlap
    region while maintaining the class definition
  * Addition of an (optional) Extra Byte Variable Length Record to describe
    "extra bytes" stored with each point

* Other minor changes

  * Added definitions for "LAS Domain Profile" and "LAS Domain Profile
    Description"

Conformance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data types used in the LAS format definition are conformant to the 1999
ANSI C Language Specification (ANSI/ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("C99").
